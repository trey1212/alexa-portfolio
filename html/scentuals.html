                        <p>
                            Scentuals is a Canadian owned and operated skincare brand and small business focused on producing high quality, 
                            ethically sourced, natural and organic products. The company is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. In addition 
                            to the 'Scentuals' line, the business has a variety of subsidiary brands that centre similar values and provides 
                            wholesale products.

                    <li>Elevating the Scentuals Brand
                        <p>
                            In addition to creating and editing existing packaging design, I explored ways to evolve the Scentuals brand while 
                            still adhering to their existing visual and brand guidelines. Clear values in using clean, safe-to-use, natural products, 
                            and empowering small family-operated Canadian businesses made it easy to elevate Scentuals into a fresher look, 
                            highlighting their messaging and pushing the brand into a more modern and contemporary feel.

                <p>
                    Working in collaboration with Langton PR, a Toronto-based communications and PR company, we strategized 
                    content and created a robust social media calendar. Working with them to recieve customer feedback, we found that customers felt 
                    they found the Scentuals’ online presence lifeless and boring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In response, we refreshed the Instagram to reflect the elevated identity for a more personal and diverse feed. We liked the clean 
                    and bright look, but did not like the focus on product photography. Rather than posting only products we wanted to incorporate 
                    intentional lifestyle shots to convey a cohesive Scentuals experience. I solidified and created assets for the new direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, knowing how important daily posts and regular content is, I pitched a new direction for the Scentuals’ social 
                    media by stressing the importance of Instagram Stories, and executed them daily with a more casual, approachable feel.

                Creative Direction with Opagee: a Scentuals Subsidary Brand 
                <p>
                    Opagee was a previous brand underneath Scentuals with a goal to appeal to spa clientele. I supported the Lead Designer 
                    with creating a clean and modern look to compliment his logo and label design by owning the product photography that would 
                    go into sellsheets, catalogues and social media.
