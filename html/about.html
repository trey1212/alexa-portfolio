            <div id="open">Hi again,</div>

                <p>
                    I'm a visual and graphic designer with a strong communications background and an enthusiasm for illustration 
                    and storytelling based out of Vancouver, BC. Listening and learning from other people's stories is the driving idea 
                    behind my design approach because it is integral for understanding how to engage meaningfully with communities and create impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My work and projects are influenced by my continual learning of intersectionality and inclusivity, and I hope to explore 
                    design and communication in a way that keeps that perspective in mind. My signature style comes from a love of play and experience; 
                    bringing together tight typography, readable layouts, and accessible design practices with playful and colourful uniformity. 
                    I enjoy designing for people.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work you'll find me anywhere with live music and a boogie, at the thrift, frolicking at the renaissance 
                    faire, writing, or cozying up with a good book and my dog.
                </p>
                
                <p>Let's work together!</p>
